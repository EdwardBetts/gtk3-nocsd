# gtk3-nocsd - Wrapper to apply gtk3-nocsd to application
#
# Usage: ln -s gtk3-nocsd ~/bin/evince
#
# Create a symlink to this wrapper script with the name of the program
# you want run without client-side decorations. This wrapper script
# will run the first matching executable in the PATH that is *not* a
# script. This wrapper script is useful if you don't want to add
# gtk3-nocsd to your system-wide LD_PRELOAD or if you only want it
# applied to certain applications.
