gtk3-nocsd ChangeLog
====================

New in version 2
----------------

  * fix crash because the development SONAME for Glib/GObject was
    referenced, instead of the SONAME of the package itself
    (Thanks to Simon McVittie)
  * fix crash with some GDK2 applications
  * add wrapper script for starting applications without CSDs
    (Thanks to nandhp)
