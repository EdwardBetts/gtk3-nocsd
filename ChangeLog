gtk3-nocsd ChangeLog
====================

New in version 2
----------------

  * fix crash because the development SONAME for Glib/GObject was
    referenced, instead of the SONAME of the package itself
    (Thanks to Simon McVittie)
  * fix crash with some GDK2 applications
  * add wrapper script for starting applications without CSDs
    (Thanks to nandhp)
  * don't use compiler-supported TLS (__thread) but rather use
    pthread_(get|set)specific, to make sure no DTV overflow entry
    is used by this library (fixes GitHub issue #11)
