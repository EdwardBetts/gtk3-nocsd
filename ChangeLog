gtk3-nocsd ChangeLog
====================

New in version 3
----------------

  * Improvements to the documentation (Thanks to Bharat G)
  * Add bash completion support for gtk3-nocsd wrapper
  * Also override GtkDialog's GtkBuildable->add_child and the instance
    initializer of GtkShortcutsWindow; previously CSDs weren't removed
    from all windows because of that
  * Drop compositor trick in Gtk+3 3.16.1 or higher; we reimplement the
    set_titlebar function there anyway, and the compositor trick only
    causes problems with newer Gtk+3 versions
  * Selectively disable decorations: don't drop the application menu
    icon by using set_show_close_button (FALSE), but instead replace
    the decoration_layout string of header bars to remove the "icon",
    "minimize", "maximize" and "close" buttons
  * Add a test that verifies that no Glib/Gtk symbols are imported
    during link time (to make sure preloading works with BINDNOW
    binaries that don't use Gtk)
  * Apply custom CSS for cosmetic improvements of the header bar look
    when CSDs are disabled (should be largely theme-agnostic, but
    tested against Adwaita)
  * Thanks to Christoph Anton Mitterer for reporting many of these
    issues

New in version 2
----------------

  * fix crash because the development SONAME for Glib/GObject was
    referenced, instead of the SONAME of the package itself
    (Thanks to Simon McVittie)
  * fix crash with some GDK2 applications
  * add wrapper script for starting applications without CSDs
    (Thanks to nandhp)
  * don't use compiler-supported TLS (__thread) but rather use
    pthread_(get|set)specific, to make sure no DTV overflow entry
    is used by this library (fixes GitHub issue #11)
